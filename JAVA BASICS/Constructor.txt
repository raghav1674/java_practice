We come to know about the Constructor.

- it is an instance member having the same name as the classname,

- it is like a function or method but not a method.

- it is used to neccesasry things which we want to do after the memeory has been alloted to the object.

- when no constructor made by the user , the default constructor is there.

- we can override the constructor as well.

- it can have any access specifiers.

- there is not copy constructor as there is no static way of creating the object.
