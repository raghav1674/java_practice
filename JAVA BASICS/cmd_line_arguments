we come to know that there are two ways of executing a program:
        - gui : double click or from some ide.
        - cli : from cmdprompt.


we then come to know about the cmd line arguments in cpp/c:

EXAMPLE:
```c

#inlcude<stdio.h>

// argc : count of the arguments passed to the main method 
and argv : array of arguments (in string).

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){

   printf("%s",argv[0]);  // filepath or filename which is being executed is passed by  the os to the main function.

// we can pass more arguments which we stored as string in argv and the count is stored in the argc.



}



```

we then came to know that the java is written by somebody in cpp and its execuatble is what we run and the code of that java.cpp would be:

suppose: filename is java.cpp.

int main(int argc,char* argv[]){

    
    call to JVM(argv[1:]) except the java which is the filename all are passed.




}
JVM(argv[1:]){


    main(String argv[2:]) // are passed and the first value is treated as the className in which the main method is defined and that's why the filename should be same as the class having the main method in Java.
}


cmdline in JAVA:
```java

class Example{

    public static void main(String[] args){

        for(int i=0i<args.length;i++){

            System.out.println(args[i]);
        }

    }
}
```
