String class is a final class in the java.lang package and we can create the Strng either using the String literal or using the String constructor
- when we create the String using the literals and if the sequence of characters in that literal is same then tow objects will not be created
and the reference will be same.

- there are some methods defined in the String class:
    - indexOf('char',[position]): returns the index starting from the position else -1.
    - lastIndexOf('char',[position]): indices remains the same but searching from right to left.
    - substring(start,stop): stop is exclusive.
    - equals(): compares the value.
    - equalsIgnoreCase(): case insensitive matching.
    - compareTo(): returns the difference of first misMatch Ascii value.
    - replace('char to be replace','to which the char to be replaced')
    - endsWith(): returns true or false.
    - startsWith():
    - toCharArray(): returns char[]
    - charAt(index): returns the character at that specified index. 

    
- String is immutable ie we cannot change the string once created.
